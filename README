  code..1  calculating studentsMarks 
 in the first code challenge its more of control flow ,finding marks of students with 
 a specific input.
 i choose to use the if and else conditional statements, if the students didnt get the(A)
 then they got an other grade depending with the input 
the if and  else work with conditons if the iput aligns with condition it returns a value or statements 
   

code..2 calculating speed
The second code challenge is also a control flow questions asking the programmer to create a program  for calculating speed.
i used a ternary operator to create the program since the options and conditions were only 2.
if the speed is less than 70 then its okay ,otherwise above 70 it should print demeritpoint
 

let speed= speed< 70 ? "ok" : "5km>70 printdemirit point"
