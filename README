## program for calculating studentsMarks 
The first code challenge its more of control flow ,finding marks of students with 
 a specific input.
 i choose to use the if and else conditional statements, if the students didnt get the(A)
 then they got an other grade depending with the input. 
The if and  else work with conditons if the iput aligns with condition it returns a value or statements 

if input > 79
return (A)
else if (condition) which means otherwise if they didn't get the (A)

##code..2  calculating speed.

The second code challenge is also a control flow question asking the programmer to create a program  for calculating speed.
i used a function  followed by a conditional statement to create the program since the options and conditions were only 2.
if the speed is less than 70 then its "okay " ,otherwise above 70 it should print demeritpoint
depending with excess divide by 5
javascript
```
if input <70
return "ok"
else if input > 70
excess divide by 5
return a demerit point
 



##code ..3  calculating netsalary
 
 this program calculate final salary (netsalary)after deduction from basic(gross)
 you should have basic salary so that after deducting taxes that is 
 PAYE
 NHIF
 NSSF
you can get net salary.
1. first, you declare function paye 
work with workflow
either conditional statements
2. second declare function NHIF
use the same control flow
similarly that should be done on NSSF
